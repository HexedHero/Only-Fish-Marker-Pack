# Metal-Marker-Megapack
This Marker Pack is primarily developed by Metallis.6105 (Discord: Metallis#9388).

I develop this pack as I have time (which is quite limited) and focus my efforts primarily on usage with [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/) over [GW2 TacO](http://www.gw2taco.com/) as Blish provides some nice QoL features to make the markers and trails a little less obtrusive while still being useful.

This pack provides many sets of markers and trails, primarily based on the hard work from [Tekkit's](http://tekkitsworkshop.net/index.php/gw2-taco/download) and [ReActif's](https://www.heinze.fr/taco/?lang=en) packs, with some cosmetic changes to make them a little less obtrusive and sleeker, in addition to some further minor optimizations.

**THIS PACK GENERALLY ASSUMES THE FOLLOWING**
1) You have and can apply common sense. There are usually as few markers and icons as I can manage while still conveying the necessary information, for visibility's sake.
    - EX: If you're following a specifc trail, you know what to look for when it terminates. Think PSNA. I won't mark the person specifically.
2) You have access to gliding and (most) mounts, but not necessarily all advanaced movement skills like [Ley-Line Gliding](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ley_Line_Gliding), [Bond of Faith](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bond_of_Faith_(mastery)) or [Ash Legion Mount Stealth](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ash_Legion_Mount_Stealth).

For a full list of features, hop on over to the Wiki. (Planned for future)
