# Metal-Marker-Myriad
This Marker Pack is primarily developed by Metallis.6105 (Discord: Metallis#9388).

I develop this pack as I have time (which is QUITE limited) and focus my efforts primarily on usage with [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/) over [GW2 TacO](http://www.gw2taco.com/) as Blish provides some nice QoL features to make the markers and trails a little less obtrusive while still being useful.

I strive to make my markers and trails (especially trails) as inclusive as possible and will be doing everything in my power to use the following [all-variant-colorblind-friendly color palette](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23000000-%23E69F00-%2356B4E9-%23009E73-%23F0E442-%230072B2-%23D55E00-%23CC79A7) wherever possible! I highly encourage my other packmaker friends to adopt these where possible, the decision was made with what input I could gather from colorblind friends.

**THIS PACK GENERALLY ASSUMES THE FOLLOWING**
1) You have and can apply common sense. There are usually as few markers and icons as I can manage while still conveying the necessary information, for visibility's sake.
    - EX: If you're following a specific trail, you know what to look for when it terminates. Think PSNA. I won't mark the person specifically.
2) You have access to gliding and (most) mounts, but not necessarily all advanaced movement skills like [Ley-Line Gliding](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ley_Line_Gliding), [Bond of Faith](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bond_of_Faith_(mastery)) or [Ash Legion Mount Stealth](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ash_Legion_Mount_Stealth).

**CURRENT CONTENTS:**
- Siege Turtle Food Farming (the dreaded Kale farm, plus some marks for other)
