# Metal-Marker-Megapack
This Marker Pack is primarily developed by Metallis.6105 (Discord: Metallis#9388).

I develop this pack as I have time (which is quite limited) and focus my efforts primarily on usage with [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/) over [GW2 TacO](http://www.gw2taco.com/) as Blish provides some nice QoL features to make the markers and trails a little less obtrusive while still being useful.

This pack provides many sets of markers and trails, primarily repurposed from [Tekkit's](http://tekkitsworkshop.net/index.php/gw2-taco/download) and [ReActif's](https://www.heinze.fr/taco/?lang=en) packs, with some cosmetic changes to make them a little less obtrusive and sleeker, in addition to some further minor optimizations.

For a full list of features, hop on over to the Wiki. (Planned for future)

Support Discord: N/A for now
